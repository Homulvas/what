This is a python script used to track new albums on what.cd torrent tracker.
It scans the folder names in your music folder then uses these artist names to look up their albums on what.cd.
Initially it will create a database with all the albums your artists have realeased so this shouldn't be used for verifying whether you have everything in your library.
After then it will show only albums that appeared on what.cd tracker after your last run of the script.

You need to setup your what.cd credentials and path to your library(it only reads the top layer folder names) to use the scrept.
After this run it from console typing "scrapy crawl what". You may need to install scrapy first.
